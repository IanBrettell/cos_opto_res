# Setup

# Test data

Test video here on local: `~/Documents/Data/20210104_cos_videos/recorded_with_iphone.avi`

Tried segmenting using `idtrackerai`, but it couldn't distinguish the fish against the background.
As there are no crossovers, try `ilastik` intead.

## Convert AVI to H5 for Ilastik

```{r, engine='bash'}
python3 code/scripts/20210106_avi2h5_fynn.py \
  ~/Documents/Data/20210104_cos_videos/recorded_with_iphone.avi \
  ~/Documents/Data/20210104_cos_videos/recorded_with_iphone.h5
```
